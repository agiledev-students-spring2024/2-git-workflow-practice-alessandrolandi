# Is Software Gettting Worse?

[link to article](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/12/25/is-software-getting-worse/)

I really enjoyed reading this article. The author tries to answer the question of if, and why, published software is worse than the software of yesteryear. To summarize, software engineers aren't worse, and software engineers still value speed and efficiency. However, non-technical stakeholders prioritize features over under-the-hood speed and reliability. Of note in this class, the author mentions, "the Agile age has taught them that bugs will inevitably exist and youâ€™ll fix them on an ongoing basis". Agile development and SaaS have long replaced pre-packaged software which had to be lightweight and bug-free. Unfortunately, consumers aren't willing to pay for software either, which leads developers to implement other ways to monetize their apps, inevitably bloating the experience with ads and data collecting tools. The author makes other points about retention and addiction being synonymous but overall I found it interesting how the author ties a distinct shift in priorities to the downfall in hyper-efficient software. 

## Alex Hmitti's comments

Really interesting article, thanks for sharing. I agree with many of the points made by the author and how changing priorities and monetization strategies impact software quality and user experience. However I think there is hope. Aside from the new wave of technology "like WebAssembly, ESBuild, SWC, Bun, and Yew) [that enable] new levels of speed and reliability", there are AI assistants and other tools that will enhance software development processes.
